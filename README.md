Git hub repository to introduce myself

My name is Evan Sadasivan. I'm a graduate of University of Notre Dame and University of Dallas. I currently work at Boston Consulting Group.

My career goal is to become a financial analyst or consultant

I chose fintech because I'm fascinated by how rapidly the field is developing and I see huge opportunities to change how people live through fintech.
